# Motion detection and tracking
## Introduction
Motion detection is the process of detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its surroundings or a change in the surroundings relative to an object. The background of our video stream is largely static and unchanging over consecutive frames of a video.  If we can model the background, we monitor it for substantial changes.
